# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: An empty tree after a discovery explains itself

When the discovery of every enabled workspace folder has ended without an error and without tests or tasks, the Testing view SHALL show, next to VS Code's own text, a RobotCode hint that no tests or tasks were found, where tests are looked for (the `paths`, profiles and `.robotignore` of the folder's `robot.toml`) and that problems while reading them appear in the Problems view, with the actions **Refresh Tests** and **Troubleshooting**.

#### Scenario: Project without tests

- **WHEN** the workspace folder has a `robot.toml` whose `paths` point to a folder without suite files, and discovery has ended
- **THEN** the Testing view shows the RobotCode hint with both actions

#### Scenario: Only resource files

- **WHEN** the workspace folder contains resource files but no suite file with tests or tasks
- **THEN** the Testing view shows the RobotCode hint

#### Scenario: Refresh Tests

- **WHEN** the user creates a suite file with a test and clicks **Refresh Tests** in the hint
- **THEN** the test appears in the tree and the hint disappears

#### Scenario: Troubleshooting

- **WHEN** the user clicks **Troubleshooting** in the hint
- **THEN** the troubleshooting page of the VS Code guide opens

#### Scenario: Project with tests

- **WHEN** the workspace folder has suites with tests
- **THEN** the tree shows them and no hint is shown

#### Scenario: Failed discovery

- **WHEN** discovery fails, for example because `paths` in `robot.toml` names a folder that does not exist
- **THEN** the tree shows the workspace item with the error, as before, and no hint is shown

#### Scenario: Several folders

- **WHEN** the workspace has two folders, one with tests and one without
- **THEN** the tree shows the tests of the first folder and no hint is shown

### Requirement: A switched-off integration says so

When the Test Explorer integration is switched off for every workspace folder, by `robotcode.testExplorer.enabled` or `robotcode.disableExtension`, the Testing view SHALL show a RobotCode hint that names the setting, with an action that opens the settings at `robotcode.testExplorer`.

#### Scenario: Integration switched off

- **WHEN** `robotcode.testExplorer.enabled` is `false` for the only workspace folder
- **THEN** the Testing view shows the hint that names the setting, and its action opens the settings filtered to `robotcode.testExplorer`

#### Scenario: Switched on again

- **WHEN** the user sets `robotcode.testExplorer.enabled` back to `true`
- **THEN** the hint disappears and the tests of the folder appear in the tree
