## What is RobotCode?

RobotCode is a comprehensive toolkit for Robot Framework development, offering advanced features to enhance your productivity and streamline your workflow. Whether you're using Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, or other LSP-compatible editors, RobotCode ensures a consistent and seamless experience.

### Key Advantages:

- **Built on Robot Framework Core**
  RobotCode uses Robot Framework's native parser for syntax validation, error messages, and behavior, ensuring full compatibility and reliability in your projects.

- **Powered by the Language Server Protocol (LSP)**
  By leveraging the LSP, RobotCode provides real-time code navigation, intelligent auto-completion, and refactoring capabilities across various editors and IDEs.

- **Multi-Platform IDE Extensions**
  RobotCode offers robust extensions for Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ Platform, delivering the same high-quality features regardless of your preferred development environment. Thanks to LSP, it also works with editors like Neovim and Sublime Text.

- **Enhanced CLI Tools**
  Extend Robot Framework's command-line capabilities with tools for test execution, debugging, and code analysis. Features include `robot.toml` support, a Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) debugger, and an interactive REPL for quick experimentation.

With RobotCode, you can focus on building and testing your automation workflows while enjoying an integrated and efficient development experience.


## Key Features

## Requirements

### Python and Robot Framework Versions
- Python 3.10 or newer
- Robot Framework 5.0 or newer

### IDE Support

- Visual Studio Code 1.99.0 or newer
- PyCharm 2025.1 or newer or IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1 or newer

### Deprecated Python and Robot Framework Versions

**⚠️ DEPRECATION WARNING:**
Support for Python 3.8, 3.9, and Robot Framework 4.1 is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. To ensure compatibility and benefit from ongoing improvements, please upgrade to Python 3.10 or later and Robot Framework 5.0 or later.

**Python Version Requirements:**
Although Robot Framework still supports Python 3.8 and 3.9, RobotCode requires Python 3.10 or newer due to its use of more modern libraries and features. Many key tools in the ecosystem—such as robocop and the Browser library—have already dropped support for Python 3.8, which is no longer maintained. Python 3.9 will reach end-of-life on October 5, 2025.

**Robot Framework Version Requirements:**
Robot Framework 4.1 is outdated. Given the regular release cadence of Robot Framework—typically two major versions per year—maintaining support for older versions introduces significant overhead. That effort is better spent on supporting current and upcoming features.

**Compatibility and Limitations:**
RobotCode currently remains compatible with Python 3.8+ and Robot Framework 4.1+, but with important limitations:
	•	New features may not be available for older versions.
	•	Development and testing efforts are focused on newer versions.

**Why Python 3.10:**
After Python 3.9 reaches end-of-life, RobotCode will start using Python 3.10+ features that are not backward-compatible. Python 3.10 introduces several important improvements, including:
	•	Structural pattern matching
	•	More informative error messages
	•	Simplified type hints using the | operator
	•	Performance enhancements

These capabilities enable cleaner, more efficient code and improved developer experience.

**Recommendation:**
To get the most out of RobotCode, we recommend using:
	•	Python 3.10 or newer
	•	Robot Framework 5.0 or newer


## Getting Started

### Visual Studio Code

1. **Install the RobotCode Extension**
   Open the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=d-biehl.robotcode) and install the RobotCode extension.

2. **Set Up Your Environment**
   Configure your Robot Framework environment using the tools and commands provided by the extension or the `robot.toml` file.

3. **Start Testing**

4. **Explore More**
   Visit the [Getting Started Guide](https://robotcode.io/02_get_started/) for detailed setup instructions and advanced features.

**Extensions:**
RobotCode declares dependencies on the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Python Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy) extensions so VS Code installs them when required. Additional extensions may be needed depending on your project.


### IntelliJ IDEA or PyCharm

1. **Install the RobotCode Plugin**
   Choose one of the following methods to install the RobotCode plugin in your IDE:

   - **Install via the Built-in Plugin Marketplace**
      Navigate to:
